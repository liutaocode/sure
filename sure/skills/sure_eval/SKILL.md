description: Run reproducible inference from an approved model's sealed container or local Python binding, then execute the selected evaluation pipeline and stage complete results for review.

# /sure_eval

Orchestrate inference plus deterministic evaluation for a model that has been human-approved into a configured `approved_models_roots` directory. Container bindings mount approved storage read-only. A site-approved Python binding runs on a trusted host and verifies model-core hashes before and after execution. New evaluation products are staged under repository-local `sure/results` for later human promotion.

A private distribution may carry an upstream main-flow mirror under `references/main_flow_agent/` for audit and parity review only. The public distribution omits that mirror. It is never a runtime template or execution source; adapt harness execution only under this skill package.

**Prerequisite**: run `/sure_init` first to select an agent, configure auth, and validate the environment for this project.

Control principle: **agent decides scope, scripts enforce format and execution.** You (the agent) choose which datasets, what target, how to route; the deterministic scripts under `scripts/` and the hook gates enforce that every artifact is in the right place, the right format, and the right value domain — and that execution-surface isolation plus the user-selected execution policy hold.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Meaning |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `model` | ✅ | Exact approved directory name below a configured `approved_models_roots` entry. No path, alias, environment-root, or local-model fallback is accepted. |
| `datasets` | ✅ | Comma-separated source paths below a configured `allowed_source_roots` entry, e.g. `datasets=/srv/sure/datasets/group/store/ds_pool/example@v1.0.2`. The strict main flow rejects legacy dataset names and short aliases; multi-version sources require the trailing `@<version_id>` (single-version sources may omit it). Dataset metadata, not a user-supplied task flag, determines ASR/TTS/VC/etc. |
| `datasets_root` | — | Absolute writable projection root for generated JSONL indexes and metadata. Resolution precedence is this parameter, `SURE_EVAL_DATASETS_ROOT`, `datasets.projection_root` in site policy, an explicit config's `data.datasets`, then the repository development default. It must stay outside forbidden output roots and must not overlap a source root. Raw data is referenced in place and is never copied or moved. |
| `protocol` | — | `standard_system` (default) follows the approved model's upstream configuration. `strict_core` requires every conservative parameter to be mapped to an MCP argument or explicitly proven not applicable. |
| `device` | — | `auto \| cpu \| cuda \| cuda:<index>`. Default `auto`; resolved by `scripts/resolve_eval_input.py` and passed through inference/evaluation templates when materialized. For `execution=local`, `cuda:<index>` selects the local host GPU by setting `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<index>`. For `execution=vc`, the allocated container GPU is addressed as `cuda:0`; choose hardware with `vc_partition`/`vc_gpu`, not a host CUDA ordinal. |
| `target` | — | Target metric or paper to compare against. |
| `max_samples` | — | Sample cap for bounded validation runs. Omitted or `0` means full dataset. |
| `execution` | — | `auto \| local \| vc`. Default `auto`; containers prefer VC when available, while approved Python runtimes are local-only. `vc` requires an approved container and a real submission. |
| `execution_path` | — | Legacy alias: `auto \| vc_submit \| local_docker \| local_python`. `local_bash` is normalized to the approved local runtime; arbitrary host inference is forbidden. |
| `vc_partition` / `vc_cpu` / `vc_mem` / `vc_gpu` | — | Optional VC resource overrides. The image cannot be overridden and always comes from the approved deployment binding. |
| `metrics` | — | Comma-separated reported metrics, e.g. `metrics=cer`. Selects the current default route per metric; use an exact `pipeline_id` via `/sure_reval` for route variants. |
| `vc_job_name` | — | Optional vc job name recorded with the submit result. |
| `config` | — | Explicit harness evaluation config path (otherwise materialized from the engine's `config/default.yaml`). |
| `evaluation_backend` | — | `external` (default) delegates metrics to the engine; `legacy` is compatibility/debug only. |
| `evaluation_engine_root` | — | Explicit engine checkout override, same role as `SURE_EVALUATION_HOME`. |
| `audit` | — | When true, triage existing results instead of running a new evaluation. |
| `run_id` | — | Resume a specific run. |
| `output_dir` | — | Absolute directory that becomes this invocation's product directory, replacing the repository-local `sure/results/<model>/<protocol>/<run_id>` staging path. The harness consumes it at `pre_start` and resolves it into the payload before the agent starts, so read `runtime.run_dir` rather than this parameter. It must be outside every configured `forbidden_output_roots` entry, creatable and writable; under `execution=vc` it must be on storage the container can mount. |
| `template` | — | Execution-surface template name under `scripts/templates/`. |

The invocation directory holds control artifacts under `.sure/runs/<run_id>/artifacts/`. The evaluation product directory recorded in `eval_input_resolved.json -> runtime.run_dir` is the source of truth for prediction, protocol, report, metric, and sample-level artifacts. It defaults to repository-local `sure/results/<model>/<protocol>/<run_id>`, and is the requested directory itself when the invocation passed `output_dir`. The `model_dir` parameter is forbidden.

At `pre_start`, the hook resolves the product input into
`<run_dir>/artifacts/eval_input_resolved.json` by running
`scripts/resolve_eval_input.py`. This artifact is the bridge from the
user-friendly `/sure_eval model=... datasets=... device=...` surface to the
upstream `MAIN_FLOW_INPUT` shape documented in
`references/contracts/main_agent_spec.md`:

- `target.model_name/model_dir/tool_workflow_ready/integration_state` and the
  immutable deployment binding come only from the approved NFS model directory.
- `constraints.allowed_datasets` is the canonical expanded dataset list.
- `constraints.allowed_tasks` is inferred from dataset JSONL metadata.
- `runtime_context.output_dir`, `device_request`, `device_resolved`, execution
  request/plan, `max_samples` sample scope, and
  `available_scripts` are recorded before the state machine starts.

Immediately after input resolution, `pre_start` runs
`scripts/preflight_evaluation_support.py`, which writes
`<run_dir>/artifacts/evaluation_preflight.json`. When the sure-evaluation
package has no route for a requested (task, language, metric), the artifact
records `supported: false`, the fixed reason code
`EVALUATION_PACKAGE_UNSUPPORTED`, and the fixed reason string, and the flow
stops before any unit runs — an unsupported route is terminal, so no retry is
attempted. When the engine is unavailable the preflight is skipped and later
stages report the engine problem themselves.

Do not ask the user for `task` as the primary input. If a legacy prompt includes
`task=asr` or similar, treat it only as a consistency hint; the source of truth
for evaluation task routing is the dataset metadata resolved into
`eval_input_resolved.json`.

At `execution_readiness`, the hook also resolves
`<run_dir>/artifacts/evaluation_route_plan.json` by calling the standalone
`sure-evaluation` route/capability contract through
`scripts/resolve_evaluation_route_plan.py`. This artifact is the source of
truth for supported metrics, default metrics, selected metric route choices,
pipeline ids, node chains, required input roles, and selected node environment
readiness. Do not infer metric support, normalization, transcription, or
scoring chains inside harness code when this plan is available.

## State Machine

Advance happens **only** when the current unit's `produces` artifact is compliant (location + format + value domain; no forbidden fields). Linear units are agent self-driven; gate units additionally run a Python semantic check. Produce the current unit's artifact, then call `sure_update_state`.

| # | Unit | Kind | Produces | Gate script |
|---|------|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | `task_classification` | linear | `task_classification.json` | — |
| 2 | `tool_readiness_routing` | **gate** | `tool_readiness_routing.json` | — (in-process: blocks on `handoff_to_tool_agent=true`) |
| 3 | `plan` | linear | `main_agent_plan.json` | — |
| 4 | `dataset_scope` | linear | `dataset_decision.json` | — |
| 5 | `script_routing` | **gate** | `script_routing.json` | `scripts/check_script_routing.py` |
| 6 | `execution_surface` | **gate** | `execution_surface.json` (+ `run_evaluation.sh`) | — |
| 7 | `execution_readiness` | **gate** | `execution_readiness_report.json` | `scripts/check_execution_surface_compliance.py` |
| 8 | `smoke_test` | **gate** | `smoke_test_result.json` | `scripts/run_smoke.py` |
| 9 | `submit_vc_run` | **gate** | `submit_result.json` | `scripts/vc_check.py` |
| 10 | `execute_wait` | **gate** | `execution_result.json` | `scripts/wait_vc_execution.py` |
| 11 | `assessment` | **gate** | `assessment_report.json` | `scripts/check_assessment.py` |
| 12 | `extract_lessons` | **gate** | `extraction_declaration.json` | `scripts/check_memory_extraction.py` |
| 13 | `run_report` | **gate** | `main_agent_run_report.json` | `scripts/check_run_report.py` |

### Per-unit contract (Inputs → Output → Allowed → Must Not Do → Failure)

Each unit must satisfy: **Inputs** (previous unit's produces + evidence sources to read) → **Output** (`produces` JSON, schema in `schemas/`) → **Allowed** (value domain) → **Must Not Do** (forbidden fields that belong to later units — anti step-merge) → **Failure** classification.

- **task_classification**: Inputs = `eval_input_resolved.json` + exact NFS model. Output = `task_classification.json` {task_type, reason, need_tool_workflow, confidence, input_signals}. Allowed: task_type ∈ {onboarding_then_evaluate,evaluate_existing_model,repair_broken_model,audit_results}. Must Not Do: do not select datasets or set `execution_path`/`report_persisted` (later units); do not add memory fields to `task_classification.json` (its schema forbids extra keys). Also read `artifacts/memory_context.json` when it exists: the `pre_start` hook writes it with the memory facts that match this cluster, model and datasets, shape `{schema: "sure.memory.context.v1", skill, target_id, facts: [{entry_id, title, path, scope, checked_at, stale, status}], omitted_provisional}`; the file is written even when nothing matched (`facts: []`); it is advisory, verify before relying, and `stale: true` means the fact is older than its scope's re-check limit. Routing for the rest of the memory tree is `references/memory/ROUTING.md`.
- **tool_readiness_routing**: Inputs = exact approved NFS model with `artifacts/deployment_ready.json`, `runtime_inventory.json`, `package_gate.json`, and their declared hashes. Readiness requires either a `docker-registry`/digest-pinned/container-only binding, or a `package=none`/uv/content-addressed Python binding permitted by the active site. Python additionally requires model-core hashes and the matching site runtime. Missing or inconsistent fields route back to `/sure_onboard` and human promotion.
- **plan**: Inputs = task classification + tool readiness + `eval_input_resolved.json`. Output follows `main_agent_plan.schema.json` and describes execution order only.
- **dataset_scope**: Inputs = `eval_input_resolved.json` + explicit human constraints. Output = {selection_basis, selected_datasets, skipped_datasets}. User-provided datasets are validated/canonicalized here; this unit should not silently invent a different dataset scope.
- **execution_surface** / **execute_wait**: produce the declared JSON; see `schemas/`. Do not emit later-unit fields.
- **script_routing**: Output steps[] each {name, script}. name ∈ the whitelist (see `schemas/script_routing.schema.json`); `script` must resolve under `scripts/`.
- **execution_surface**: Output {entrypoint_path or entrypoint, source_provenance.template_file, deployment_binding}. The script comes only from `scripts/templates/`. Copy the approved binding summary from `eval_input_resolved.json` exactly, including its schema version, runtime kind, bundle identity, execution mode, model integrity policy, and writable result policy. Current resolved bindings use `sure.eval.deployment_binding.v2`; historical container-only v1 surfaces remain accepted. Container surfaces also bind the immutable image. Do not invent or override a model interpreter.
- **execution_readiness**: `check_execution_surface_compliance.py` compares the surface binding with the approved input, rejects `local_bash`, unapproved `.venv`/host interpreters, image changes, model-policy mismatches, and tool mismatches. It live-probes the exact approved container or site Model Python and validates the standalone evaluation route plan. On `vc_submit` the probe rehearses work the VC container will do, so a submitting node that cannot start a container at all records a warning instead of blocking; the same failure on `local_docker`, where that docker is the execution environment, still blocks, as does any probe that came up and reported a broken runtime.
- **smoke_test**: bounded smoke on a tiny slice using the approved local container or Python runtime; `smoke_passed` true.
- **submit_vc_run**: Containers use `vc_submit` or `local_docker` according to the resolved policy. Python uses `local_python` and is never submitted to VC. Neither route may infer or rewrite a model `.venv`.
- **execute_wait**: For VC, run `scripts/wait_vc_execution.py --run-dir <sure_run_dir> --wait`. The waiter matches the current submission token, prefers the atomic terminal sentinel, and uses `vc info`/`vc describe` only to classify missing-container and timeout cases. Do not hand-author polling or a terminal result. A result with `completion_source: "wait_timeout"` and `job_status: "running"` means the waiter's own clock ran out, not that the job failed: run the same command again (pass a larger `--timeout-seconds`, default 7200, when the job is expected to run longer than that), and do not go read job logs to decide — every such detour re-enters this gate and spends a retry on a healthy job. Local Docker and Python runners already write their own result, which this gate validates.
- **assessment**: {anomaly_detected, user_confirmed}. Anomaly (e.g. WER/CER > 50%, Accuracy < 20%) requires user confirmation.
- **extract_lessons**: Inputs = `artifacts/run_digest.json`, written by the hook the moment `assessment` passed (read it; never rebuild it in place). Output = `extraction_declaration.json` {schema, no_new_lessons, no_lessons_reason, covered_by, candidates, infra_noise, infra_evidence} plus 0 to 5 candidate directories under `artifacts/candidates/<nn>-<slug>/` (`proposal.json` + `proposal.md`) and, for facts, evidence files under `artifacts/memory_evidence/`. The full contract (digest fields, candidate formats, the gate's ten checks, the write-tools-only rule) is `sure/runtime/memory/EXTRACTION.md`; read it before writing anything. Write candidates and evidence first and the declaration last. `no_new_lessons: true` with a one-line reason is the normal result of a clean run. Must Not Do: do not run `scripts/build_run_digest.py` onto `artifacts/run_digest.json` (a preview goes to `--out <run_dir>/artifacts/run_digest.preview.json` and the gate ignores it); do not write under `sure/memory/` or `references/memory/`; do not use bash heredocs for these files. Failure: `scripts/check_memory_extraction.py` says which check failed; after two consecutive failures the hook advances on its own with `extraction: failed`, and switching to `no_new_lessons: true` with the reason is always a valid way out.
- **run_report**: {report_persisted, execution_path_actual}. Record `execution_path_requested`, `execution_path_actual`, `device_request`, `device_actual`, `max_samples`, total dataset samples, and evaluated samples. Non-vc paths are valid for explicit `execution=local`; auto local fallback requires a reason and, if vc was available, explicit fallback approval.

## System Constraints (red lines — non-negotiable)

```
[SYSTEM_CONSTRAINT: EXECUTION_SURFACE_ISOLATION]
When materializing the execution surface (run_evaluation.sh):
1. ALLOWED_TEMPLATE_ROOTS: "scripts/templates/"
   - The generated script MUST be derived ONLY from a template under this approved root.
   - Use `scripts/templates/` for harness-adapted executable templates.
   - Any distribution-provided audit mirror under `references/main_flow_agent/templates/` MUST NOT be used as a runtime template root.
   - You MUST NOT use any template outside this root.
2. TEMPLATE_DECLARATION:
   - execution_surface.json -> source_provenance.template_file MUST contain the
     exact path of the template used, and it MUST resolve under an approved root.
3. SELF_VERIFICATION:
   - Before declaring execution_ready=false if unsure. The execution_readiness gate
     runs scripts/check_execution_surface_compliance.py against the declared template.

[SYSTEM_CONSTRAINT: EXECUTION_POLICY]
The user controls where formal model inference runs:
1. EXECUTION_REQUEST:
   - `execution=local`: run the materialized surface through its approved `local_docker` or `local_python` binding.
   - `execution=vc`: submit the approved container through VC. Python bindings reject this request.
   - `execution=auto` or omitted: containers prefer VC when available; Python bindings select their site-approved local-only route. Any container fallback records its reason.
2. DEVICE_REQUEST:
   - `device=cpu` hides `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.
   - `device=cuda:<index>` records the user request, sets `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<index>` for local execution, and records process-visible `device_actual=cuda:0`.
   - For `execution=vc`, `device=auto|cuda|cuda:<index>` resolves to the container-visible `cuda:0`; a nonzero requested ordinal is preserved in provenance with an explanatory note because VC physical GPU selection is controlled by `vc_partition`/`vc_gpu`.
3. PROVENANCE:
   - `submit_result.json`, `execution_result.json`, `prediction_generation_status.json`, `protocol.yaml`, and `main_agent_run_report.json` record the exact image digest, execution location, device, and mount policy.
```

## Artifact Protocol

Generated prediction runs write `prediction_generation_status.json` with schema
`sure.eval.prediction_generation_status.v2`. The source of truth is what the
harness actually sent and where it executed:

- `runtime`: MCP server command, container working directory/Python, exact image ref, and `runtime_inventory.json` v2 summary. Local onboard Python remains evidence only.
- `environment`: allowlisted safe env values, all env keys, redacted secret-key names, execution path, and device binding.
- `generation`: protocol resolver output, explicit `--tool-arg` values, argument key policy, and raw-response observation.
- `datasets`: per-dataset prediction file, structured prediction file, generation count, logs, and status.

`protocol.yaml` is inference-only. It must include `inference_parameters`,
`prediction_reuse`, and `provenance`. For normal `/sure_eval`, provenance points
to the current run's `prediction_generation_status.json`; for `/sure_reval`,
`prediction_reuse.enabled=true` and provenance points to the source inference
protocol/status/runtime inventory when available. `raw_response` is preserved in
`predictions/<dataset>.jsonl` as model-output evidence only and must not be used
to infer model hyperparameters.

Only `standard_system` and `strict_core` are valid protocol IDs. `standard_system`
is the default and applies no harness generation override; its resolution records
the approved `config.yaml` path and SHA256. `strict_core` injects the mapped
conservative values into the actual MCP tool arguments. Missing mappings,
unsupported parameters, resolver failures, and conflicting `--tool-arg` values
are terminal errors. A null mapping is allowed only with
`status=not_applicable` and a concrete architecture reason.

## Backend

The deterministic harness backend is bundled in `scripts/`. The package
`scripts/sure_eval/` holds the model, dataset, inference, report, and legacy
evaluation compatibility code. Formal metric execution should prefer the
standalone `sure-evaluation` engine when it is available. Flat scripts under
`scripts/` (`resolve_eval_input.py`, `resolve_model_dir.py`,
`resolve_evaluation_engine.py`,
`resolve_evaluation_route_plan.py`, `prepare_sure_dataset.py`,
`materialize_predictions_template.py`, `generate_predictions_via_server.py`,
`validate_prediction_files.py`, `evaluate_predictions.py`,
`refresh_report_snapshot.py`, `run_local_execution.py`, `run_vc_execution.py`,
`wait_vc_execution.py`,
`check_execution_surface_compliance.py`) are the routing targets. Templates live
in `scripts/templates/`. Run them as:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/<script>.py <args>   # cwd = skill package dir
```

For `execution=local`, call `scripts/run_local_execution.py --run-dir <sure_run_dir>`
from the submit unit. It runs `run_evaluation.sh` through the approved container or
site Model Python and writes
both `submit_result.json` and `execution_result.json`. For `execution=vc`, use
`scripts/run_vc_execution.py --run-dir <sure_run_dir>` from the submit unit. It
writes `submit_result.json`, includes the exact `vc submit` command and a
persistent `<sure_run_dir>/vc_logs/job.log`, and leaves final
`execution_result.json` to `scripts/wait_vc_execution.py --run-dir <sure_run_dir> --wait`
in the following `execute_wait` unit. The generated VC entrypoint atomically
writes a tokenized terminal sentinel on exit, so pod cleanup cannot erase the
authoritative exit code. When vc resources
are selected at submit time, the effective digest-pinned image, partition, CPU,
GPU, memory, entrypoint, and log snapshot is recorded in both `submit_result.vc_submission`
and `execution_surface.vc_runtime.resolved_submission`.
All execution routes inject the Model Python and server command declared by
`runtime_inventory.json`, plus the independently resolved, versioned common
`HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN`. Container routes resolve both roles inside the image. Python
routes resolve the portable Model Runtime ID against the active site's
`storage.runtime_root`, pass a sanitized environment, redirect caches into the run
directory, and verify model-core hashes before and after execution. The two
executables are validated separately and must not silently collapse to the same
interpreter. Host model-interpreter overrides and `.venv` rewrites are rejected.
The standalone evaluator uses a third role, `SURE_EVALUATION_PYTHON`. Its root
dependencies are resolved from the versioned contract under
`sure/runtime/evaluation/`, cached by engine commit and lock hash under
`sure/.runtime/evaluation/`, and recorded in `evaluation_route_plan.json`,
`evaluation_payload.json`, and `protocol.yaml`. It may be prepared online only
during evaluation readiness and only from the committed lock. Never install an
evaluation dependency into Harness Python or Model Python. Node-local evaluation
environments remain owned by the selected pipeline nodes, and a run never builds
one: no `uv venv`, no `uv sync`, no searching storage for a wheel. The per-node
`uv sync` in the metric READMEs is a maintainer instruction for preparing an
engine checkout, not a step inside a run. A missing node environment is a blocker
to report, not to repair inline — one run spent twenty minutes compiling a
normalization dependency, hit its own timeout, and produced nothing.

Report it like this. `evaluation_route_plan.json` names every node that is
missing under `node_environment_blockers`, each with its `node_id`, its
`node_env.yaml` group, and the `prepare_command` that builds it. That command is
`sure-eval env setup --node <node_id>`, run once per engine checkout by whoever
owns the checkout, never from inside a run — the environments live at
`<engine>/src/sure_eval/evaluation/nodes/<node_id>/.venv` and are gitignored, so
each checkout needs its own. Carry the blocker and the command into the run's
report and stop; do not run the command, and do not go looking for a wheel.

Resolve an approved model with:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/resolve_model_dir.py --model Qwen__Qwen3-ASR-1.7B --require-verdict --require-runtime-files
```

`sure/models/<model>` is an onboarding staging product and is never an eval input. An operator promotes verified models into NFS.

The standalone evaluation engine resolves to `sure/external/sure-evaluation` by
default. In a GitHub-backed harness worktree, this path should be a Git
submodule that points at the independent `sure-evaluation` repository. Use
`SURE_EVALUATION_HOME` or `--evaluation-engine-root` only as an explicit local
override; the workspace checkout is not an implicit fallback.
Input resolution always materializes `<run_dir>/_harness_config.yaml` from the
selected config and binds its dataset entry to the resolved writable projection
root. The first run creates `sure_benchmark/jsonl` plus generated indexes and
metadata there. Source `sample.jsonl`, `ds.jsonl`, and raw audio remain under the
configured `allowed_source_roots`; execution mounts those source roots and the
approved model read-only. Configure the projection with `datasets_root`,
`SURE_EVAL_DATASETS_ROOT`, or site policy `datasets.projection_root`. The
repository-local `data/datasets` path is only the development fallback.

`evaluate_predictions.py` accepts `--evaluation-backend auto|external|legacy`
and `--strict-main-flow`. Harness main-flow templates default to
`EVALUATION_BACKEND=external` and `STRICT_MAIN_FLOW=1`; this prevents the
default path from falling back to the vendored legacy evaluator. Use `auto` or
`legacy` only for explicit local compatibility work, not for aligned main-flow
validation. Metric support is discovered from the current standalone
`sure-evaluation` engine at runtime; the harness must not maintain a separate
static support matrix.
For generated-audio tasks, pass an explicit audio metric when needed, for
example `--metric dnsmos` or `--evaluation-metric dnsmos`; the harness converts
structured TTS/VC/SE predictions into the standalone engine's `samples_jsonl`
contract according to the selected route's required roles. Repeated `--metric`
values produce one dataset-metric result each, and `--merge-payload` merges
segmented TTS/VC evaluation payloads without rerunning metrics.
SE defaults to the atomic `si-sdr` route. Full-reference SE metrics require an
explicit clean `reference_audio`; the noisy model input is never reused as the
clean reference. Other SE metrics run only when their standalone route and node
environment are ready.

`run_smoke.py` launches the approved local container or site Model Python with a
bounded sample. `generate_predictions_via_server.py --device cpu` hides
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` in the selected runtime; it never falls back to an
unapproved host interpreter.

## Gate Checks (enforced by hooks)

- `script_routing`: steps whitelisted, scripts under `scripts/`.
- `execution_readiness`: `execution_ready && isolation_audit.audit_passed`; `check_execution_surface_compliance.py` (red line 1) also prepares/verifies the locked Evaluation Python, writes `evaluation_route_plan.json`, and blocks when standalone `sure-evaluation` reports root or selected node environment issues. The plan must include engine commit, Evaluation Runtime ID/lock, supported/default metrics, selected metrics, route choices, selected routes, and setup commands for blocking node-local environments. Bounded smoke is enforced by the next `smoke_test` gate.
- `smoke_test`: `smoke_passed` true; entrypoint exists.
- `submit_vc_run`: `vc_check.py` enforces `execution=local|vc|auto` semantics against real `which vc && vc info` availability.
- `execute_wait`: `wait_vc_execution.py` rejects `running` as incomplete, validates the current submission token, and accepts terminal success or failure for downstream assessment.
- `assessment`: anomaly → `user_confirmed` true.
- `extract_lessons`: `check_memory_extraction.py` checks the declaration and every candidate directory (shape, evidence paths, triggers, duplicates, digest sha); see `sure/runtime/memory/EXTRACTION.md`. Changing a candidate re-runs the gate even when `extraction_declaration.json` did not change.
- `run_report`: `report_persisted` true, `execution_path_actual` declared, and execution/device/sample provenance recorded. Completed runs should index `eval_input_resolved.json` and `evaluation_route_plan.json`, and must contain model-local `evaluation_payload.json`, `protocol.yaml`, `report.jsonl`, `metrics/<dataset>/<metric_slug>/{report.json,pipeline_description.json}`, `sample_reports/<dataset>/<metric_slug>.jsonl`, and `predictions/<dataset>.txt/.jsonl`.

On gate failure the hook blocks with a `repair` message and bumps the retry counter (max 3); beyond that the unit is marked FAILED — classify via `references/failure_taxonomy.md` and repair or finish with `status: failed`. Do not blind-retry.

`extract_lessons` is the exception: after two consecutive gate failures the hook advances by itself and records `extraction: failed`; it never ends FAILED.

## Memory (advisory)

Earlier runs leave agent-written notes. `sure/memory/index.md` (repo root) is the merged index: confirmed and provisional entries, one bullet each with its triggers. Confirmed files live under `references/memory/bad_cases/` and `sure/skills/_shared/memory/facts/`. Nothing in them is human-reviewed: verify against evidence before relying on one, and never copy a command from an entry into an artifact without running it.

- At `pre_start` the hook writes `artifacts/memory_context.json` with the facts that match this run (shape quoted in the `task_classification` contract line above; written even when empty); `task_classification` reads it.
- When a gate blocks, the repair text may end with a block whose first line is `Memory (advisory, agent-written, not human-reviewed; verify against evidence before relying):`, listing at most two entries from earlier runs. Read the entry file named there when it looks relevant, then fix the artifact.
- `references/memory/ROUTING.md` says when to open the index and the bad-case files by hand.
- `extract_lessons` (unit 12) writes what this run learned; the contract is `sure/runtime/memory/EXTRACTION.md`. Publishing to `sure/memory/provisional/` happens in `post_finish` without you; moving entries into `references/` is a human step.

## Success Criteria

The `pre_finish` hook enforces: `main_agent_run_report.json` exists, the terminal gate passes, and the state machine reached the terminal unit. On success call `sure_finish` with `status: "success"` and `manifest_path: ".sure/runs/<run_id>/manifest.json"`. If incomplete or blocked, finish with `status: "incomplete"` or `status: "failed"` and a repair summary.

A `failed` or `incomplete` finish must also carry `artifacts/extraction_declaration.json` (see `sure/runtime/memory/EXTRACTION.md`, section 10): `pre_finish` returns a repair asking for it up to twice, then lets the run finish and records `extraction: failed`.

name: sure-trans
description: Transform an existing Dockerfile, model path, and inference entrypoint into the digest-pinned container-only model bundle consumed by SURE Eval. Use when a model already has a delivery environment and inference code but does not yet implement the SURE ModelWrapper and MCP contracts.
---

# /sure_trans

Convert an existing model delivery into the same Eval-ready contract produced by `/sure_onboard`. Preserve the supplied source files, materialize a source image, add a generated adapter layer, validate original and adapted inference, push an immutable image, and seal `sure/models/<model_name>/`.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dockerfile` | yes | Existing Dockerfile absolute path. |
| `model` | yes | Existing model file or directory absolute path. |
| `inference_entrypoint` | yes | Existing inference entrypoint absolute path. `inference_code` is an alias. |
| `framework` | yes | Computation framework. Must be `pytorch`; accept `torch` as an alias. |
| `model_framework` | yes | Model implementation framework. Prefer `transformers`; other safe identifiers such as `wenet`, `funasr`, or `custom` are allowed and require an architecture clarification. |
| `build_context` | no | Default to the Dockerfile parent directory. |
| `source_image_policy` | no | `auto` (default), `load`, or `build`. `auto` tries a tar below `build_context`, then falls back to Dockerfile build. |
| `image_tar` | no | Explicit image archive absolute path. It must be inside `build_context`. |
| `model_name` | yes | Must use `<organization>__<model-name>`; all bundle and image names use this value. |
| `task_type` | no | Canonical values include `asr`, `kws`, `s2tt`, `sa_asr`, `sd`, `se`, `ser`, `gr`, `slu`, `tts`, `tse`, `vad`, and `vc`. Voice/speech activity detection aliases normalize to `vad`; speaker diarization aliases normalize to `sd`; SA-ASR and speaker-attributed ASR aliases normalize to `sa_asr`; speech-enhancement aliases normalize to `se`; target-speaker-extraction aliases normalize to `tse`; emotion, gender, and spoken-language-understanding aliases normalize to `ser`, `gr`, and `slu`. Artifacts store canonical values only. |
| `fixture` | no | Absolute smoke input path. Most tasks require one audio file plus a same-stem `.expected.json`. KWS requires 2 to 5 keyed positive/negative rows. SE requires 1 to 5 keyed noisy/clean pairs. TSE requires 1 to 5 keyed `{sample_id,mixture_audio,enrollment_audio,reference_audio}` rows. VAD requires 1 to 5 keyed `{audio,speech_segments}` PCM-WAV rows. SD and SA-ASR require 1 to 5 keyed `{audio,segments}` rows. |
| `device` | no | `auto` (default), `cuda`, or `cpu`. `cpu` validates with local Docker only; `cuda` and GPU-capable `auto` submit VC jobs to the dedicated partition `<vc_default_partition>`. |
| `model_mount_target` | no | Default to `/models/<model_name>`. |
| `model_stage_policy` | no | `auto` (default), `copy`, or `hardlink`; materialize the model payload into the final bundle. |
| `vc_partition` | no | VC partition for GPU validation; default and site requirement `<vc_default_partition>`. |
| `vc_memory_gb` | no | VC memory request in GiB; default 32. `<vc_default_partition>` caps each GPU at 32 GiB, so do not exceed it there. |
| `vc_gpus` | no | VC GPU count; default 1. |
| `image_version` | no | Explicit tag override for the site-resolved target repository. When omitted, query both resolved source and adapter repositories, find the highest `major.minor.patch` tag, and select the next unused patch version; an empty repository starts at `0.1.0`. |
| `max_retries` | no | Default 3. |

```

## Boundaries

- Treat `inference_entrypoint` as an entrypoint, not a complete dependency bundle.
- Treat the Docker build context, model path, declared support paths, and installed packages as the only allowed dependency roots.
- Do not scan filesystem roots or silently adopt same-named files from shared storage.
- Do not modify the supplied Dockerfile, model, or inference source in place.
- Keep model data outside the image, materialize it into `sure/models/<model_name>/`, and mount that approved bundle read-only.
- Treat MCP as the model invocation protocol. CPU validation runs in local Docker; GPU-touching validation submits VC jobs to `<vc_default_partition>`.
- Require the primary computation framework to be PyTorch. Auxiliary preprocessing may use native binaries or ONNX Runtime when recorded as a support dependency.
- Prefer Transformers as the model framework, but do not block a custom or other declared PyTorch model framework. Record the declaration, detected category, architecture signals, and clarification in `framework_detection.json`; rely on original inference, adapter inference, and equivalence gates for behavioral proof.

### Per-unit contract

Every unit's inputs, output fields and failure rules are described in the sections
below and in `schemas/`. One unit produces nothing a transformation needs and is
therefore spelled out here:

- **extract_lessons**: Inputs = `artifacts/run_digest.json`, written by the hook the moment `verdict` passed (read it; never rebuild it in place). Output = `extraction_declaration.json` {schema, no_new_lessons, no_lessons_reason, covered_by, candidates, infra_noise, infra_evidence} plus 0 to 5 candidate directories under `artifacts/candidates/<nn>-<slug>/` (`proposal.json` + `proposal.md`) and, for facts, evidence files under `artifacts/memory_evidence/`. The full contract (digest fields, candidate formats, the gate's ten checks, the write-tools-only rule) is `sure/runtime/memory/EXTRACTION.md`; read it before writing anything. Write candidates and evidence first and the declaration last. `no_new_lessons: true` with a one-line reason is the normal result of a clean run. Must Not Do: do not run `scripts/build_run_digest.py` onto `artifacts/run_digest.json` (a preview goes to `--out <run_dir>/artifacts/run_digest.preview.json` and the gate ignores it); do not write under `sure/memory/` or `references/memory/`; do not use bash heredocs for these files. Failure: `scripts/check_memory_extraction.py` says which check failed; after two consecutive failures the hook advances on its own with `extraction: failed`, and switching to `no_new_lessons: true` with the reason is always a valid way out.

## Deterministic Scripts

Run harness scripts from this skill directory with `HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN`.

Resolve the inputs first:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/materialize_trans_inputs.py \
  --dockerfile <absolute-Dockerfile> \
  --model <absolute-model-path> \
  --inference-entrypoint <absolute-inference-file> \
  --framework pytorch \
  --model-framework transformers \
  --task-type <task> \
  --device <auto|cuda|cpu> \
  --vc-partition <partition> \
  --vc-memory-gb <gib> \
  --vc-gpus <count> \
  --run-dir <run_dir> \
  --repo-root <repo_root>
```

Forward every user-provided optional parameter from the slash command into this invocation. Omitted `--vc-*` flags resolve to `<vc_default_partition>`, 32 GiB, and 1 GPU. Forward `--image-version` only when the user supplied it; otherwise input materialization reads the authenticated Registry V2 tag lists for both `<model_name>-source` and `<model_name>`, selects the next patch version, and records the repositories and observed tags in `trans_input_resolved.json.image_version_resolution`. Registry lookup failure blocks instead of guessing a possibly occupied tag.

Inspect the static dependency closure:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/inspect_dependencies.py --run-dir <run_dir>
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/detect_framework.py --run-dir <run_dir>
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/prepare_fixture.py --run-dir <run_dir>
```

`detect_framework.py` blocks only when static evidence cannot establish PyTorch as the primary computation framework. A non-Transformers PyTorch model remains `status=ready`; the script writes `architecture_clarification` and any detected architecture signals, and the final verdict carries the same review information.

`prepare_fixture.py` copies both the selected audio and its same-stem `.expected.json`, writes `gt.jsonl` before the fixture gate runs, and records SHA256 for all three. For KWS it copies only `gt.jsonl` and its referenced nested audio paths, requires unique keys and explicit polarity, normalizes `expected_detected` / `expected_keyword`, derives WAV duration when needed, and records each file hash plus a fixture-tree identity. For SE it copies only the 1 to 5 explicitly referenced noisy/clean pairs, normalizes `audio` to the noisy role while preserving `reference_audio`, rejects path escape/symlink inputs, and hashes both roles plus the complete fixture tree. For TSE it copies 1 to 5 keyed mixture/enrollment/reference triples, keeps clean `reference_audio` only in staged ground truth, and never sends that role to the model. For VAD it copies 1 to 5 keyed PCM-WAV rows, keeps reference `speech_segments` only in staged `gt.jsonl`, proves duration from PCM bytes, and permits an empty reference only for byte-verified pure silence. For SD/SA-ASR it copies 1 to 5 keyed audio rows and preserves structured reference segments only in staged `gt.jsonl`. Every structured path rejects duplicate keys, path escape, symlinks, and malformed intervals. Model predictions and equivalence baselines are never accepted as ground truth.

Materialize the source image with the resolved policy:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/run_docker_build.py \
  --run-dir <run_dir> \
  --produces <run_dir>/artifacts/source_image_result.json
```

The source build automatically uses a generated Dockerfile layer that installs `git` and `ca-certificates` when `git` is absent. It supports apt, apk, dnf, yum, and microdnf; the supplied Dockerfile is never modified and its final `USER` is restored. A loaded source image tar receives the same derived layer before validation.

With `source_image_policy=auto`, the runner recursively searches only below `build_context` for `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, or `.tgz` files. An explicit `image_tar` wins; otherwise candidates are ranked deterministically using in-context `delivery.json`, `SHA256SUMS`, and adjacent `image-inspect.json` evidence. Paths declared outside the current build context and symlinked archives are ignored.

The runner verifies any declared archive checksum, executes `docker load --input <tar>`, and confirms the loaded tag and live image ID with `docker image inspect`. If discovery, checksum, load, or inspection fails, `auto` executes `docker build --progress plain --file <Dockerfile> --tag <generated-tag> <build_context>`. `load` blocks instead of falling back; `build` skips archive discovery. Commands, logs, attempts, archive hash, Dockerfile hash, and the final live image identity are recorded in `source_image_result.json`.

Static analysis is evidence, not proof. Build the source image, create `execution_compat.json` with `status=pending`, and let the gate run `run_execution_compat.py`. It probes Python, Torch, Transformers, CUDA, and BF16 inside the source image.

Execution surfaces split by device:

- `device=cpu`: the probe runs in local Docker without `--gpus`; `execution_surface=local_docker`.
- `device=cuda` or GPU-capable `auto`: the gate pushes the source image to `trans_input_resolved.json.container_delivery.source_image` and submits the probe through `vc submit` on `<vc_default_partition>`; `execution_surface=vc` with `vc_partition`, `vc_job_id`, `vc_memory_gb`, `vc_gpus`, and `vc_submit_command` recorded.
- `auto` with a model that does not require CUDA falls back to a local CPU probe only after the VC CUDA probe fails or times out; the fallback evidence is recorded in `fallback` and `execution_surface` stays `vc`. When `vc` is unavailable or the partition is not permitted, the gate blocks with a clear repair instead of silently falling back.

For original and adapter smoke units, write the stage artifact with a real `run_command`. The original inference and adapter inference artifacts also need `input`, the staged fixture the command consumes (`staged_path` from `fixture_manifest.json`), and the MCP artifact needs `tool_name`, the tool the adapter exposes. The gate executes the command through `run_trans_validate.py`, captures stdout/stderr and exit status, and only then writes the matching pass field. A manually written `status=passed` is not sufficient. A required field the artifact omits blocks the unit and spends a retry before the command ever runs, so write them all in one go.

The four adapter stages share one validation directory. `validate.py` reads `SURE_VALIDATE_ARTIFACTS_DIR` for everything it writes and reads, and the contract stage reads back the `sample_output.json` the infer stage wrote there. Mount **one** host directory for all of `import`, `load`, `infer`, `contract` and point the variable at it:

```bash
-v <run_dir>/artifacts/adapter_validation:/validation:rw -e SURE_VALIDATE_ARTIFACTS_DIR=/validation
```

Giving each stage its own directory makes the contract stage fail with `Missing sample output` every time, however well inference went, and each attempt spends a gate retry.

When the model is validated on GPU, `run_command` must be a `docker run ...` list (with `-v`/`-e`/`--entrypoint`/`-w` flags); the gate translates it into a VC job with the same mounts, environment, and command. `--mount` and unknown flags are rejected. On `device=cpu` a plain list or shell string also works.

When `--entrypoint` is omitted, the translation resolves the image ENTRYPOINT/CMD from the local Docker daemon via `docker image inspect` and applies the same docker semantics (entrypoint + positional args, or entrypoint + image CMD when no args are given). An explicit `--entrypoint` always wins. If the image is not present locally, the gate blocks with a repair telling the agent to add `--entrypoint` explicitly or load the image.

After original inference passes, materialize the model payload into the final model bundle:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/stage_model_payload.py --run-dir <run_dir>
```

`auto` attempts hardlinks and falls back to copies. The final approved model directory must contain the actual payload because `/sure_eval` mounts only that directory; an external absolute model path is not an executable handoff.

Scaffold the adapter after original inference passes:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/scaffold_adapter.py --run-dir <run_dir>
```

Replace the generated `adapter/model.py` scaffold with a model-specific wrapper. Prefer direct Python import and persistent model loading. Reject a per-sample subprocess that reloads the model unless no persistent integration exists and the user explicitly accepts the limitation.

## Adapter Contract

Implement:

```python
class ModelWrapper:
    def load(self) -> None: ...
    def predict(self, input_data): ...
    def healthcheck(self) -> dict: ...
```

Keep `server.py` protocol-only. Use stdin/stdout JSON-RPC, write logs to stderr, and expose the task tool declared in `config.yaml`. For ASR, expose `transcribe_audio` with `audio_path` and return a JSON-serializable object containing non-empty `text`.

For KWS, expose `kws_predict` with `audio_path`, optional `keywords` (`string` or `string[]`), and optional `threshold`, whose only formal value is `0.5`. Return all three direct summary fields: `detected: boolean`, `keyword: string|null`, and `score: number|null`. Scores are confidence values in `[0,1]`; `detected` must agree with `score >= 0.5`. A negative result may use `{detected: false, keyword: null, score: null}` for accuracy-only smoke, or a score below `0.5`. Macro-recall and DET evaluation require scores for every sample. False and null are valid values, not empty output. A positive result requires the expected keyword and a score at least `0.5`. Do not make Eval infer these fields from an untyped event list.

For SE, expose `enhance_speech` with required `audio_path` and optional `output_path`, and return `{audio_path: string}`. When `output_path` is supplied, write the enhanced PCM WAV there. Validation always supplies a deterministic path below `SURE_VALIDATE_ARTIFACTS_DIR/outputs`; returned files outside that writable directory, empty files, symlinks, or unreadable/non-PCM WAVs fail.

For TSE, expose `extract_target_speaker` with required `mixture_audio_path`, `enrollment_audio_path`, and `output_path`, and return `{prediction_audio: string}` (an optional matching `sample_id` is allowed). The clean `reference_audio` and `reference_text` roles are evaluation-only and must never appear in MCP arguments or prediction output. The returned prediction must be the harness-assigned, independent, non-symlink, non-empty PCM WAV below `SURE_VALIDATE_ARTIFACTS_DIR/outputs`; the TSE output schema is `schemas/tse_output.schema.json`.

For VAD, expose `detect_speech` with only `audio_path` and return `{speech_segments: [...]}` with optional `frame_scores`. Every speech segment is a closed `{start,end}` object with finite `0 <= start < end`, ordered without overlap, and bounded by the PCM-WAV duration. Empty `speech_segments` are valid only for byte-verified pure silence. Each frame score is a closed `{start,end,score}` object with finite score in `[0,1]`; when present, frame scores must start at zero, be ordered and contiguous without gaps or overlap, and end at the PCM-WAV duration. The output schema is `schemas/vad_output.schema.json`.

For SD, expose `diarize` with only `audio_path` and return `{segments: [...]}`. Each segment requires finite numeric `start >= 0`, finite `end > start`, and a non-empty `speaker`. An empty segments array is valid for all-silence audio.

For SA-ASR, expose `transcribe_with_speakers` with only `audio_path` and return a non-empty `{segments: [...]}`. Each segment follows the SD fields and additionally requires non-empty `text`. The output schemas are `schemas/sd_output.schema.json` and `schemas/sa_asr_output.schema.json`; runtime gates additionally enforce finite values, `end > start`, and non-whitespace strings.

Never pass fixture reference segments to `ModelWrapper.predict` or MCP `tools/call`. The generated validation and smoke drivers read references only to validate fixture integrity and align output keys; model arguments contain exactly `audio_path` for VAD, SD, and SA-ASR.

The adapter image always bakes `/opt/sure_trans/mcp_smoke.py` (copied by `scaffold_adapter.py`). All MCP protocol verification runs that deterministic driver: it spawns `server.py`, drives `initialize` / `tools/list` / one `tools/call` per fixture row / `shutdown` over stdin with bounded deadlines, and writes `mcp_smoke.json` evidence. KWS proves both polarities; SE assigns and hashes generated audio; VAD, SD, and SA-ASR validate every structured result while passing only `audio_path`. Evidence records portable fixture-relative names and SHA256 values rather than host audio paths; finalization also projects run/model/repository roots out of `mcp_result.json`. Never write ad-hoc MCP test scripts, and never start the server bare without driving requests — a bare server waits on stdin forever. The MCP stdout channel must stay a pure JSON-RPC stream: the generated `server.py` redirects model-library stdout to stderr during `tools/call`, and `mcp_smoke.py` skips stray non-JSON stdout lines while reading responses (recording them as `stdout_junk_*` evidence) — model loading progress prints must never corrupt the protocol.

Equivalence is decided by the gate, not by the command. Write `equivalence_result.json` with `baseline_output` and `adapter_output` as paths to recorded output documents. KWS files use keyed structured results. SE files use `{rows: [{key, result: {audio_path}}]}` and compare audio content. VAD files use keyed `{rows:[{key,result:{speech_segments:[...],frame_scores:[...]?}}]}`; SD/SA-ASR files use keyed `{rows:[{key,result:{segments:[...]}}]}`. Structured baselines and adapter results must be independent files under their separate run-owned roots; same-inode aliases fail. The gate validates every interval and compares the complete result JSON for every key. An exit code alone never proves equivalence.

## Image Packaging

1. Materialize the source image with `run_docker_build.py`; default `auto` loads an in-context image tar first and falls back to a deterministic Dockerfile build.
2. Use `adapter/Dockerfile.sure` to layer `/opt/sure_trans/model.py`, `server.py`, `config.yaml`, `model.spec.yaml`, `__init__.py`, `validate.py`, and `mcp_smoke.py` onto the source image. The generated Dockerfile also copies the locked Harness Runtime into `/opt/sure-harness/<runtime_id>/`. If `SURE_HARNESS_RUNTIME_IMAGE` is set to a digest-pinned runtime image, build with `--build-context sure_harness_runtime=docker-image://<repository>@sha256:<digest>`; otherwise use `--build-context sure_harness_runtime=<SURE_HARNESS_RUNTIME_ROOT>`.
3. Mount the staged `sure/models/<model_name>/` bundle read-only at `model_mount_target` for load, infer, MCP, and pull-verification tests.
4. Validate import, persistent load, real inference, output contract, MCP initialize/list/call, and equivalence with original inference as separate gates.
5. Push the adapter image to `trans_input_resolved.json.container_delivery.target_image`, resolve `sha256:...`, pull the exact `repository@sha256:...` reference, and repeat the MCP smoke test. Registry transport and authentication are deployment concerns; use the Docker daemon configuration for the active site. When the model was validated on GPU, the post-pull MCP smoke must itself run on VC through `mcp_smoke.py`; submit the **tag** with `--expect-digest` (see the VC section below — `vc submit` rejects digest-pinned references) and record its `vc_job_id`, `vc_partition=<vc_default_partition>`, `exit_code=0`, `image_ref`, the `resolved_digest` the submission proved, and the log path as `post_pull_smoke` in `docker_registry_result.json`, keeping `mcp_smoke.json` evidence next to that log path (the registry gate checks `resolved_digest` against `target_image_digest` and the initialize/tools/list/tools/call evidence).

The source image is pushed before unit 6 and the adapter image before unit 11 by the gate scripts; both record `registry_ref` and `registry_push` evidence into `source_image_result.json` and `adapter_image_result.json` respectively. The unit 17 post-pull smoke reuses the same registry name without repushing.

Naming, image boundary, tag increment, and push-failure recovery conventions live in `references/image_packaging.md`; on conflict, this section and the gates win.

Automatic selection is advisory until the immutable push succeeds: another run can claim the selected tag after input resolution. The registry's no-overwrite policy remains the final concurrency guard. On that race, rerun input materialization to select the next free version, or pass an explicit unused `image_version`; never overwrite the existing tag.

## VC Execution

`<vc_default_partition>`, `execution.vc_project`, and the source/target image repositories are site policy values, not constants. Repositories are resolved from `network.container_registry` plus `container_delivery.repository_template` in `config/site.bundled.yaml` (or `config/site.local.yaml`) and persisted in `trans_input_resolved.json`. Read policy with `npm run sure:site-info`; never hardcode a site value in this skill.

GPU-touching work never runs `docker run --gpus all` on the login node. Gates submit to `<vc_default_partition>` through `scripts/vc_exec.py`; the same CLI drives the unit 17 post-pull MCP smoke:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/vc_exec.py \
  --image <target_repository>:<version> \
  --expect-digest sha256:<digest> \
  --command "python /opt/sure_trans/mcp_smoke.py --audio /fixture/smoke.wav --tool <tool_name> --produces <run_dir>/artifacts/vc_logs/post_pull_smoke/mcp_smoke.json" \
  --mount <bundle_dir>:/models/<model_name>:ro \
  --mount <run_dir>/fixture:/fixture:ro \
  --partition <vc_default_partition> \
  --gpus 1 --memory-gb 48 --cpus 8 \
  --log-dir <run_dir>/artifacts/vc_logs/post_pull_smoke \
  --produces <run_dir>/artifacts/vc_logs/post_pull_smoke.json
```

For KWS, replace the smoke command's `--audio ...` with `--fixture-gt-jsonl /fixture/kws/gt.jsonl --tool kws_predict`. For SE use `--fixture-gt-jsonl /fixture/se/gt.jsonl --tool enhance_speech`. A single KWS audio cannot satisfy the positive/negative gate.

For TSE use `--fixture-gt-jsonl /fixture/tse/gt.jsonl --tool extract_target_speaker`. The command calls every bounded row with only mixture/enrollment paths and validates independent generated audio plus role hashes.

For VAD use `--fixture-gt-jsonl /fixture/vad/gt.jsonl --tool detect_speech`. The command calls every bounded row and validates PCM duration, silence behavior, and optional full-timebase frame scores.

For SD use `--fixture-gt-jsonl /fixture/sd/gt.jsonl --tool diarize`. For SA-ASR use `--fixture-gt-jsonl /fixture/sa_asr/gt.jsonl --tool transcribe_with_speakers`. Both commands call every bounded row.

- `vc submit` takes `repo:tag` only: it answers `镜像不存在` to every `repo@sha256:...` reference, however well that digest pulls with docker. Submit the tag and pass `--expect-digest`; `vc_exec.py` pulls the tag, reads back the manifest digest the registry serves for it, and refuses to submit when it is not the pinned one. It records `image_ref` and `resolved_digest`, which is what the registry gate checks against `target_image_digest`. Copy both into `docker_registry_result.json` under `post_pull_smoke`. Never hand a digest-pinned reference to `vc submit`, and never write `resolved_digest` by hand.
- Defaults: 1 GPU, 32 GiB, 8 CPUs, 1800 s poll timeout. `vc_memory_gb` and `vc_gpus` from the slash command override the memory/GPU defaults; the partition defaults to `<vc_default_partition>`.
- Every submitted job wraps its container command in `timeout --kill-after=15 <seconds>` (default 1200 s, `--command-timeout-seconds` on the CLI). A hung command is killed and still writes `exit_code` (124), so the submit host never waits for a file that will never appear; exit 124 surfaces a targeted repair.
- Never submit a raw `vc submit` and then hand-roll `sleep`/`while` polling loops in bash. Re-running a job always goes through `scripts/vc_exec.py`, which polls the `exit_code` file internally and records `vc info --job` / `vc logs` diagnostics.
- Mount preparation is deterministic: the gate creates missing bind-mount host sources as the submitting user before `vc submit` (the vc platform would otherwise create them as `nobody`, which the job uid cannot write); a missing `:ro` source blocks, and an existing unwritable directory blocks with a repair telling the agent to recreate the empty scratch dir or point the mount at a user-owned path. Job-side `Permission denied` on an output mount surfaces the same repair.
- `vc submit` requires the quota project; the gates pass the `execution.vc_project` value from site policy automatically (override with `--project` on the CLI).
- Job evidence lands under `artifacts/vc_logs/<stage>/`: `inner.sh`, `stdout.log`, `stderr.log`, `exit_code`, `vc_job.log`. Push logs live at `artifacts/vc_logs/source_push.log` and `adapter_push.log`.
- The submit host polls the `exit_code` file written by the in-job wrapper; `vc info --job` and `vc logs` output is diagnostic evidence only.
- Never submit real VC jobs outside this skill's gates or a `/sure_trans` run the user started.

Memory sizing is enforced deterministically:

- `<vc_default_partition>` caps 32 GiB RAM per GPU. Before submitting a model-loading
  validation (original inference, load, infer, contract, MCP, equivalence), the
  gate compares the payload size with 2x loading headroom against
  `vc_memory_gb` and blocks with the exact fix (`vc_gpus=2 vc_memory_gb=64`).
- When a job fails with exit 137 / `OOMKilled` / `std::bad_alloc` / `Killed`,
  the gate repairs with the RAM sizing fix. A `CUDA out of memory` failure is
  confirmed from a non-zero exit code plus the OOM evidence, in the job log or
  in the stage result file the container wrote, and is then resubmitted up to
  eight times on the selected VC partition so the scheduler can place it on
  another available GPU allocation. A job that logs a recovered OOM and still
  exits 0 is a pass, not a retry. Retries also stop once the hook's gate budget
  no longer fits another attempt, which `gpu_oom_retry_budget_exhausted`
  records. The first attempt logs in `artifacts/vc_logs/<stage>/` and each
  resubmission gets its own `artifacts/vc_logs/<stage>/oom-attempt-N/`.
  The VC interface does not expose a physical GPU selector, so this is bounded
  rescheduling, not a guarantee of eight distinct cards. After the eighth CUDA
  OOM, the gate reports the existing VRAM guidance (reduce batch/beam, enable
  bf16, or shard the model).

## Eval Handoff

Generate `runtime_inventory.json` with schema `sure.onboard.runtime_inventory.v2`:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/write_runtime_inventory.py --run-dir <run_dir> --python-executable <container-python> --tool-name <tool>
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/write_verdict.py --run-dir <run_dir>
```

Verify:

- `status=ready`
- `policy.eval_runtime=container_only`
- `policy.host_python_fallback=false`
- `policy.image_override_allowed=false`
- `container_runtime.target_image_ref` to a digest-pinned image
- `container_runtime.server_command` to the adapter MCP server
- `container_runtime.mount_policy.nfs_models_read_only=true`

Write a successful `verdict.json`, then run:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/finalize_trans_bundle.py --run-dir <run_dir>
```

This seals the already-staged model payload, adapter, and small evidence under `sure/models/<model_name>/`. The sealed bundle matches the `/sure_onboard` product layout: wrapper set plus `Dockerfile.sure` at the bundle root, `fixture/<task>/` with `gt.jsonl`, and `artifacts/` carrying `package_gate.json` (`sure.onboard.package_gate.v2`), `artifact_manifest.json` (`sure.onboard.artifact_manifest.v1`), `runtime_inventory.json`, `verdict.json`, `docker_registry_result.json`, and `deployment_ready.json` (`sure.onboard.deployment_ready.v1`, written identically to the run directory). Ready bundles declare `integrity_profile=manifest-complete-v1` and `weights_integrity=bundled`; the deployment hashes cover every required wrapper, fixture, evidence file, generated sample output, and staged payload file. The terminal gate re-verifies the payload manifest, terminal timeline, hashes, bundle identity, portable paths, Dockerfile hash, and digest-pinned execution policy.

The generated `validate.py` keeps the same CLI contract as `/sure_onboard`: `--stage import|load|infer|contract|all`, writing `<stage>_result.json` and, during infer, `sample_output.json` into `SURE_VALIDATE_ARTIFACTS_DIR`, then validating that sample against the filled `io_contract` in the contract stage — from the same directory. KWS, SE, VAD, SD, and SA-ASR evaluate every bounded fixture row and write keyed `{rows: [{key, result}...]}` documents. VAD and SD permit an empty primary segment array only when the PCM WAV is proven to contain pure silence; SA-ASR does not. The adapter image embeds the locked Harness Runtime; `runtime_inventory.harness_runtime.required=true`, so `/sure_eval` uses the image binding and does not mount the repository Harness Runtime into the model container.

After completion, run evaluation locally or through VC without changing the model protocol:

```text
/sure_eval model=<model_name> execution=local
/sure_eval model=<model_name> execution=vc
```

## Stopping Without a Bundle

When one of the Failure Rules fires, the run stops where it is; it does not
finish successfully and it does not write a readiness marker by hand. Seal the
run as blocked instead, from wherever it stopped:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/finalize_trans_bundle.py --run-dir <run_dir> \
  --blocked "<what stopped the run>"
```

That writes `artifacts/deployment_ready.json` with `status=blocked`, the reason,
hashes of whatever terminal evidence exists, and
`execution_policy.container_only=false`. Nothing is staged into
`sure/models/<model_name>/`. Then call `sure_finish` with `status=failed` or
`status=incomplete`; the pre-finish hook requires that marker and refuses a
non-success finish that still claims readiness.

A `failed` or `incomplete` finish must also carry `artifacts/extraction_declaration.json`
(see `sure/runtime/memory/EXTRACTION.md`, section 10): `pre_finish` returns a repair
asking for it up to twice, then lets the run finish and records `extraction: failed`.

A gate script may rerun and replace the artifact you wrote for its unit. When
that happens the advance message says so; re-read the file before acting on
what you recorded.

## Failure Rules

- Block on unresolved Docker `COPY`/`ADD` sources or undeclared external file paths.
- Block when original inference cannot load the supplied model.
- Block when the primary computation framework is not PyTorch.
- Block when the adapter reloads a large model for every sample without explicit acceptance.
- Block KWS when the fixture lacks unique keyed positive and negative samples, or when any result omits/mistypes `detected`, `keyword`, or `score`.
- Block SE when any fixture row lacks a safe noisy/clean pair, when generated audio escapes validation outputs, or when PCM/content equivalence exceeds the declared tolerance.
- Block VAD on duplicate keys, unsafe/non-PCM audio, malformed or overlapping intervals, non-finite/out-of-range scores, partial frame-score timebases, empty speech output for non-silence, reference leakage, missing output keys, aliased evidence files, or any full-structure equivalence mismatch.
- Block SD/SA-ASR on duplicate keys, unsafe audio paths, malformed segments, reference leakage into model arguments, missing output keys, or any full-structure equivalence mismatch. SD alone permits an empty segments array for all-silence audio.
- Block when MCP output differs from original inference on the fixture: the equivalence gate compares the two recorded output files itself and fails on a mismatch even when the command exited 0.
- Block when the MCP gate has no `mcp_smoke.json` protocol evidence (initialize/tools/list/tools/call all passed with a non-empty task primary output; a `*_path` output must name a file the smoke can stat); placeholder `run_command` values such as `/bin/true` or `print(...)` are rejected.
- Block when registry push, digest resolution, exact pull, or post-pull MCP validation fails.
- Block when `vc submit` fails, the partition is not permitted, the GPU probe cannot complete, or the post-pull smoke does not exit 0.
- Block when the model payload exceeds the RAM budget (2x headroom) of `vc_memory_gb`; raise `vc_gpus`/`vc_memory_gb` instead of trimming validation.
- Stop after `max_retries` changed-artifact failures; unchanged artifacts do not consume another retry.
- `extract_lessons` is the one unit that never stops the run: `check_memory_extraction.py` checks the declaration and every candidate directory (shape, evidence paths, triggers, duplicates, digest sha), and after two consecutive failures the hook advances by itself and records `extraction: failed`. Changing a candidate re-runs that gate even when `extraction_declaration.json` did not change.

## Memory (advisory)

Earlier runs leave agent-written notes. `sure/memory/index.md` (repo root) is the merged index: confirmed and provisional entries, one bullet each with its triggers. Confirmed files live under `references/memory/bad_cases/` and `sure/skills/_shared/memory/facts/`. Nothing in them is human-reviewed: verify against evidence before relying on one, and never copy a command from an entry into an artifact without running it.

- At `pre_start` the hook writes `artifacts/memory_context.json` with the facts that match this run, shape `{schema: "sure.memory.context.v1", skill, target_id, facts: [{entry_id, title, path, scope, checked_at, stale, status}], omitted_provisional}`; the file is written even when nothing matched (`facts: []`). Read it once while resolving the input; no unit artifact takes a field for it.
- When a gate blocks, the repair text may end with a block whose first line is `Memory (advisory, agent-written, not human-reviewed; verify against evidence before relying):`, listing at most two entries from earlier runs. Read the entry file named there when it looks relevant, then fix the artifact.
- `references/memory/ROUTING.md` says when to open the index and the bad-case files by hand.
- `extract_lessons` (unit 20) writes what this run learned; the contract is `sure/runtime/memory/EXTRACTION.md`. Publishing to `sure/memory/provisional/` happens in `post_finish` without you; moving entries into `references/` is a human step.
